# UFOs
Module 12

## Purpose of the analysis:
In this analysis we are going to create a webpage that contains a table with all the UFO sighting data we have collected.

We will be using the following tools to acomplish that:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

We will use the first tool to create the table where the results will be displayed, and the other two tools will be the ones we use to design the webpage and user interface.

In the table, there will be several filters the users can use to narrow down their search by date, city, state, country and even shape of the sighting.


## Results:
You can access the webpage we have created by following this link:
