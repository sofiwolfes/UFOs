# UFOs
Module 12

## Purpose of the analysis:
In this analysis we are going to create a webpage that contains a table with all the UFO sighting data we have collected.

We will be using the following tools to acomplish that:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

We will use the first tool to create the table where the results will be displayed, and the other two tools will be the ones we use to design the webpage and user interface.

In the table, there will be several filters the users can use to narrow down their search by date, city, state, country and even shape of the sighting.


## Results:
You can access the webpage we have created by following this link: [UFO Sightings](https://rawgit.com/sofiwolfes/UFOs/main/Challenge/Starter_Code/web/index.html)

You will see the below webpage:

## How to perform a search:
On the left hand side of the website, you will find the following options to filter your search:

You can enter the filters you want, and the page will automatically narrow down the search for you.

## Summary:

### A drawback of the webpage
I believe it would be helpful if the filters have a dropdown menu that suggests the options you have, so you are not trying to filter for things that don't come up with any results.
### Additional recommendations for further development
* An interactive graphic would be helpful to have a better big-picture idea of the areas and types of sightings that have been recorded.
* I believe it would be helpful to have the availability to download the table once we have applied the filters we need.
